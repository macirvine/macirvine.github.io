    One thing that <strong>fasinates</strong> me is Analog Pinball machines. It has <strong>amazed</strong> me
    how much engineering is required in order to properly fit all the components into
    the machine properly without having any issues with heat, power, or the machine itself.
    The classic pinball machines were originally meant for gambling, or rather to circumvent it,
    and then became so popular that they became a staple of parlors and bars.
